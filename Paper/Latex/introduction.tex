\section{introduction}
The Quantum Hall effect (QHE) is one of the easiest way to measure the ration between Planck's constant
and the elementary charge. In 1985 Klaus von Klitzing discovered the QHE in a two-dimensional system, and
discovered the quantization of the Hall resistance in multiples of $h/e^2$ \cite{Gerthsen}, the later called von Klitzing constant.
Therefore it was possible to define a new resistance standard, which only depends on fundamental constants.\\
