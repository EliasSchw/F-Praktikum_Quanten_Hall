\section{Spin Orbit Coupling}

When zooming in on the oscillations longitudinal of the longitudinal resistivity, 
a beating pattern is visible.
This behaviour increases for high $U_\text{gate}$.
The resistivity for $U_\text{gate} = 1.5V$ and $1.4K$ is depicted in fig. \ref{fig:beatingPattern}.
This behaviour is likely caused by the Rashba effect, which is based on spin orbit coupling.
