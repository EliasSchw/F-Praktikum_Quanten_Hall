    \noindent The Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) was investigated in a two-dimensional electron system at low temperatures 
    and high magnetic fields. The von Klitzing constant $R_\text{K}$ was determined as $(\csname Klitzing1.4K\endcsname)\,\text{k}\Omega$, 
    confirming the quantization of the Hall resistivity $\rho_\text{xy}$ in multiples of $h/e^2$.
    The charge carrier density $n$ was measured using three different methods, yielding consistent results around 
    $(\csname nEins1.4K\endcsname) \cdot 10^{15}\,\text{m}^{-2}$. The cyclotron mass $m_\text{c}$ was determined as 
    $(\csname cyclotron15\endcsname)\cdot 10^{-2} \cdot m_\text{e}$ and $(\csname cyclotron21\endcsname)10^{-2} \cdot m_\text{e}$ for different temperature pairs.
    Additionally, Fermi parameters such as the Fermi wave vector $k_\text{F} = (\csname kFermi1.4K\endcsname) \cdot 10^{8}\,\text{m}^{-1}$, 
    Fermi energy $E_\text{F} = (\csname EFermi1.4K\endcsname) \cdot 10^{-2}\,\text{eV}$, and Fermi velocity 
    $v_\text{F} = (\csname vFermi1.4K\endcsname) \cdot 10^{5}\,\text{m/s}$ were calculated.
    It was found that there is no sign of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) in the measured data. 
    Spin-orbit coupling was observed.
