\section{Fractional QHE}

Experiments show, that the filling factor $\nu$ not only takes integer values, but also fractions $\nu=\frac{1}{2}, \frac{2}{5}, ...$.
This can partially be explained with the creation of fractionally charged quasiparticles.
This effect is typically observed for very high magnetic fields.
Since none of the curves goes beyond $\nu = 1$, 
a larger magnetic field would be required to observe fractional filling factors smaller than 1.
In principle, also fractional filling factors larger that one can occur.
