\section{Charge carrier density}
In the following section the determination of the carrier density $n$ is described in three different ways.
All determined carrier densities are listed in tab.\,\ref{tab:ns}.
\subsection{Charge carrier density extrapolation from the classical Hall effect}
In the classical Hall effect, the charge carrier density $n_\text{slope}$ is given by 
\begin{align}
    n_\text{slope} = \frac{B}{\rho_{xy}e} = \frac{1}{e \cdot m_\text{slope}}.
    \label{eq:chargeCarrierClassicalHall}
\end{align}
In our experiment, one expect to see the classical Hall effect at low magnetic fields.
As seen in fig.\,\ref{fig:KlitzingBeispielBild} the slope of the Hall resistance shows a linear behavior for small magnetic fields.
The carrier density is calculated by determining the slope $m_\text{slope}$ of the linear region using a linear regression for the data points for $B<1\,\text{T}$.
The error is calculated by Gaussian error propagation of the error of $m_\text{slope}$ obtained from the linear regression.

\subsection{Charge carrier density via Hall plateaus}
In the quantum Hall regime the carrier density can be calculated from the Hall plateaus with the corresponding filling factors $\nu$.
Therefore, $n_\nu$ can be calculated using eq.\,\ref{eq:nnu} 
\begin{align} 
    n_\nu = \frac{\nu B_\nu e}{h} \label{eq:nnu} 
\end{align} 
where $B_\nu$ is the mean magnetic field at the plateau for the corresponding fill factor.
$B_\nu$ is determined by manually reading the center of each plateau, with the error of $B_\nu$ being the uncertainty of the reading. For higher fill factors, the plateaus become narrower and the error of the reading becomes slightly smaller.
The error of $n_\nu$ is then calculated by Gaussian error propagation.
\subsection{Charge carrier density via Shoubnikow-de Haas Effect}
The Shoubnikow-de Haas Effect describes the oscillations of the longitudinal resistivity $\rho_{xx}$ with increasing magnetic field $B$.
It can be explained with the equally spaced Landau levels moving up in energy, when $B$ increases.
The charge carrier density $n_\text{SdH}$ is calculated via
\begin{align}
    n_\text{SdH} = \frac{e}{h\Delta}
    \label{eq:chargeCarrierFourier}
\end{align} 
with the periodicity of oscillations $\Delta\left(\frac{1}{B}\right)$.
To obtain the periodicity $\Delta$, the longitudinal resistivity $\rho^\prime_\text{xx}\left(B\right)=\rho_\text{xx}\left(\frac{1}{B}\right)$ is considered.
Since the measured data points are equally spaced in $B$ instead of $\frac{1}{B}$, an interpolation is performed.
A discrete Fast Fourier Transform is applied to accurately determine the period of the oscillations.
A clear peak is visible that corresponds to the estimated periodicity.
To accurately locate the peak, a Gaussian is fit to the region and the peak value of the fit is used as $\Delta$.
The error of the peak is estimated to be half the width of the Gaussian.
The Fourier transformed resistivity $\mathcal{F}\left[ \rho^\prime_\text{xx}\right]\left(f_\text B\right)$ for $1.4K$ is shown in \ref{fig:Fourier}.

    The peak is determined with a fit of a gaussian curve.
